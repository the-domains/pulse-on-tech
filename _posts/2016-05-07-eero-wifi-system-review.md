"Can you hear me? Hello? Oh, the WiFi doesn't work." "I can't hear you or see you. Are you still there?" Similar conversations occur whenever I start an online video call with my parents who live on the other side of the world. Sometimes you find your Netflix stream buffering just like the slot in Zootopia; or you can't go to your back yard with a laptop or pad because your old router can't reach that far. I bet you must have similar problems at home with buffering and dead zones. With eero, the world's first wall-to-wall WiFi home system, you can get rid of the buffering nightmare and enjoy a WiFi mesh network in your entire home.

The eero is a good looker. It's a tiny white square box with a glossy top and is elegant enough to place on your living room table. Based on your home size, you can customize the number of eero units you need. Homes are diverse, unique, and size, shape, materials and proximity to neighbors' networks all impact WiFi strength and reliability. The eero system is the home version of the enterprise routers used in office buildings that use 802.11r roaming technology. Once you set up all eeros, each unit automatically connects to each other to create a single mesh network. Once set up, the system will upgrade and fix problems automatically without your noticing.

The eero system is easy to set up. You just need to plug the first eero unit into your cable modem. Download the eero mobile app to create an eero account and one network password. Then the app will guide you to place the rest eero units at the best place. Then you can enjoy your seamless network with no dead zones. The app also manages all your eero units. Furthermore, it can create passwords for your guests using a text message.

The eero's system won't speed up your Internet connection, but to ensure the Internet access you're already paying for. Even though there are few home WiFi systems like eero, it won't be the only one in the near future. Companies like D-Link and Linksys are coming up with similar WiFi network kits this summer. If you are bothered by the bad WiFi at home, choose eero or keep an eye on the upcoming ones.
